# sketchy
Arduino (and possibly other) code for my robotic Etch-a-Sketch

This assumes that you have an Etch-a-Sketch with a pair of stepper motors attached to the pullies, and that you're using a driver such as the EasyDriver (I got mine from Sparkfun.)

Plans on how to build the mechanicals are forthcoming.
